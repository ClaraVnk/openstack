<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting started

* Log in your Openstack environnement
* Clone this repo in your Openstack directory

## Openstack summary

### 1. As a client

In your terminal, type this command : 

  ```sh
python3 openstack_summary.py
  ```

By default, you can see the last hour of billing (simply press enter), but you can choose the dates you want.

### 2. As an admin (beta)

As an Openstack admin, maybe you don't want to see the costs of all the instance, but you need to see a specific project.

  ```sh
python3 openstack_admin_script.py
  ```
